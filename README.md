# Ant Colony Optimization for Solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem

## Description

This project implements the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). The TSP is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities and returns to the starting city. ACO is a metaheuristic inspired by the foraging behavior of ants, where ants deposit pheromones on the paths they travel, and subsequent ants are more likely to follow paths with higher pheromone concentrations.

## Implementation

The project is implemented in Python using the NumPy library for numerical computations. The code simulates the movement of multiple ants through the search space, updating pheromone levels based on the quality of the solutions found. The algorithm iteratively improves the solution until a termination criterion is met.

## Results

The project demonstrates the effectiveness of the ACO algorithm in finding near-optimal solutions for the TSP. The results show the best route found, the total distance traveled, and the convergence behavior of the algorithm over time. You can modify the parameters of the algorithm, such as the number of ants, the evaporation rate, and the pheromone influence, to explore their impact on the solution quality.
